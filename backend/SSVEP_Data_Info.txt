#Format of SSVEP Data

1. Channels (Number of Electrodes): 9 Channels
- 9 occipital/parietal ElectrodesL PZ, P05, P03, P0z, P04, P06, 01, 0z, 02
- 1 reference electrode at the vertex (not typically included in the main data channels)

2. Sampling Rate (Hz): 256 Hz
- Emotiv Pro Common Range: 128 - 256 Hz
- In General: 128-1000 Hz
- Higher sampling rate increases frequency resolution but requires larger datasets

3. Time Series: 7 seconds (total)
- Baseline: 2 seconds
- Stimulus: 3 seconds
- Rest: 2 seconds
- Output a vector of voltages per time per Electrodes
    - Ex: 5 seconds with sampling rate of 256 Hz --> 1280 samples per Channels

4. Stimulus Frequencies
- Up: 10 Hz
- Down: 20 Hz
- Left: 12 Hz
- Right: 15 Hz

5. Noise and Harmonics
- SSVEP often contains noise and harmonics; include this as 2x/3x the frequency for realistic synthetic data

6. Data Shape 
- Channels x (Sampling Rate x Seconds): 9 x (256 x 7) = 9 x 1792 (9 Channels with 1792 Samples each)
- # Samples = Sampling Rate x Seconds
